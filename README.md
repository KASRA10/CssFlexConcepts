# 🧩 Flexbox Practice Projects

Welcome to my front-end portfolio focused on mastering **CSS Flexbox**! This repository contains a collection of mini-projects—cards, layouts, UI components—built using `display: flex`. It's a hands-on space for practicing layout techniques and showcasing responsive design skills.

## 📐 What is `display: flex`?

`display: flex` is a CSS property that enables **flexbox layout**, a powerful way to arrange items within a container. When applied to an element, it turns that element into a **flex container**, allowing its children (flex items) to be aligned, spaced, and ordered dynamically.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

## 🎨 What is Flexbox Design?

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model—ideal for laying out items in a **row** or **column**. It simplifies complex alignment tasks and adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.

### Key Features:
- **Direction control**: Easily switch between horizontal and vertical layouts.
- **Alignment**: Center items, space them evenly, or push them to edges.
- **Ordering**: Rearrange items without changing HTML structure.
- **Flexibility**: Items can grow, shrink, or stay fixed depending on available space.

## 📱 What is Responsive Design?

Responsive design ensures that your website or app looks great on **all devices**—from desktops to smartphones. It involves:

- **Flexible layouts** (like Flexbox)
- **Media queries**
- **Fluid images and typography**
- **Mobile-first approach**

Flexbox plays a key role in responsive design by allowing components to **reflow** and **resize** based on screen dimensions.
